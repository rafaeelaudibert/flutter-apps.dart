> Flutter is Googleâ€™s mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

In this repository, I have some explorations with Flutter, with some copied apps (copied from famous apps to train layout building/coding techniques) as well as private apps built and designed by myself.  
Each app has its own README.md explaining the intent of the app with its own exploration. Some apps will also have its own repository, through ```git submodules``` command, so you should clone this project with the following command:

```bash
$ git clone --recursive github.com/rafaeelaudibert/flutter-apps.dart
```
